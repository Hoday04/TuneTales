It's BLS from the west, I've Lost Angeles
Tryna find my way back but the map was made of cannabis
Better hurry up and find another way to handle this
Burned every tree, now there's none to hang my hammock with
Hey, tryna patch up all my damages
Staggered through the madness
Throwing hatchets at the manuscripts
Of every maggot on the planet tryna rap and spit
I'd cop your album but I'd rather read a bag of shit
Smoke a spliff that's been dipped in the madness
And take a step on your neck and get it crackin', bitch
It's BLS, Brandon Bless but he's hazardous
As tobacco is to mammals
He's standing in a buffalo flannel in Amsterdam-Ales
Couldn't find a candle to handle up as I channel this
Granted now the fandom abandoning all the analysts
Turned every critic into advocating panelists
No more time for the trash talk
Put your eyes on the black hawk
See the prize that I grasped on
I was born at the height of the rap storm
Now I smack on the back, the baby's reborn
On a road I met some detours
But I always kept my feet forward
All I need is a drum beat to seek toward
And keep my heart in my head
Swinging back and forth like a see-saw
Been living life like I'm falling down a freefall
And full of dikes who wanna write like they really raw
I bet it all, I be the nigga that will win it all
Sendin' 'em the venom that was hidden in my rhythm y'all
Hey, I was born with game
And I grew over time
And the form would change
But the core still remained the same
Now I'm 23 with buckets of change
In the court like when Jordan came
With the dunk from the free throw lane
Now all I need is the five-finger ring read 'KING'
And a catalog of classics that we can bang
Then I'm mapping out the atlas that leads the way
Hey, we don't play
What was blessed with game
So respect the name
Shahmen
Hey, we don't play
What was blessed with game
So respect the name
Shahmen
Hey, we don't play
What was blessed with game
So respect the name
Shahmen
Hey, we don't play
What was blessed with game
So respect the name
